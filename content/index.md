**Every human is an artist**  

**Every human has their own beauty**  

Drawn In asks 1000 humans to draw each other

Here we see the joyful movement of the human hand over paper

We delight in an expressive line  

We laugh at an accidental pig nose  

We risk our perfection and find unexpected beauty

On the page

And in each other

## 976 drawings until exhibition!

<br><br>

### You can also help collect drawings!

I'll need the original paper drawings for the exhibition: send/drop them off to me at:  

Dev Academy  
Level 2, 275 Cuba St  
Wellington, 6011  

<br><br>

### How to host the process
*Approach two people*  

"Kia ora, do you have <1 minute - 10 minutes> to particiate in the art project Drawn In?"  

"Uh... Ok?"  

"Great! Here's paper and pens. You're going to draw each other. It's unlikely to be flattering. It's likely to be hilarious."  

*Optional:*  
"Here's a little poem from <Leunig> to get you in the mood:  
LET IT GO  
Let it go,  
Let it out,  
Let it all unravel,  
Let it free  
And it will be  
A path on which to travel."  

"You have <1-10> minutes to draw each other. Be bold. Go!"

*They draw. Hold a space of focus and humour. Maybe laugh with genuine joy at their drawings as they go. Encourage them*

"You have 30 seconds left..."  

"3... 2... 1... Pens down!"

"Now, on the back of the drawing, write your full name. Now write the other person's first name underneath"

*Let them see and enjoy each other's drawings*  

*Invite them to the exhibition, tell them to keep up with the project and exhibition at drawnin.nz*

**Ka pai!**
