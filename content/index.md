**Everyone is an artist**  

**Everyone has a unique charm**  

Drawn In asks 1000 people to draw each other,

to experience the joy of committing ink to paper,

to laugh at an accidental pig nose.  

We risk failure and find unexpected beauty,

on the page, and in each other

### Who am I to do this?
Am I an artist? Mmm. As much as you are. I'm Pete, a 27 year old navigating friendships, family, love, work and play. I'm from a little farm half an hour north of Wellington. I lived in Manchester long enough to appreciate NZ. I love connecting with people and popping [echo chamber bubbles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_chamber_(media)) - including my own.

There's a sketch of me below - can you guess which one?  

This project is about celebrating the artist in everyone, connecting people and having a laugh together.   
Oh. And hosting an exhibition party. It's going to be awesome.

</div>

<br><br>

### You can co-host this project with me!

**If any of these tickle your fancy:**    
pop your own bubble, meet some different folk...  
gift a challenging creative experience...  
co-design a awesome exhibition...  
have a laugh with friends...   
etc...

All you need is  
- $5 for 2x notebooks and pens,
- 5 minutes sometimes

We'll need the original paper drawings for the exhibition: you can send/drop them off to me at:  

Pete Jacobson  
Dev Academy  
Level 2, 275 Cuba St  
Wellington, 6011  

Give me a bell at [peterjacobson.nz@gmail.com](peterjacobson.nz@gmail.com) to discuss!

### How to host the process
This is a rough guide to get you started. Modify it as you like.  
Key elements are:
  - respect
  - playfulness
  - humour  

*Approach two people*  

"Kia ora, I'm getting 1000 people to draw each other for the project "Drawn in". Do you have 2 minutes to particiate in this project? It's unlikely to be flattering. It's likely to be hilarious. A big part of this is letting go of judgement - appreciating whatever comes out of your pen"  

"Uh... Ok?"  

"Great! Here's paper and pens. So I'm going to read you a poem to get you in the mood, then you'll draw each other."  

"This poem is by cartoonist [Michael Leunig](http://www.leunig.com.au/), it's called 'Let it go'""  
```    
     Let it go,     
     Let it out,     
     Let it all unravel     
     Let it free,     
     And it will be,     
     A path on which to travel"     
```
*pause*  

"You may now draw each other. 2 minutes starting now!"

*They draw. Hold a space of focus and humour. Maybe laugh with genuine joy at their drawings as they go. Encourage them. Exact timing isn't important.*

"You have 1 minute left..."

"You have 30 seconds left..."  

"3... 2... 1... Pens down!"

"Now, on the back of the drawing, write  
"Artist: <Your Name>"  
and underneath that  
"Subject: <Name of Person you Drew>"

*Let them see and enjoy each other's drawings*  

*Invite them to the exhibition, tell them to keep up with the project and exhibition at drawnin.nz*

**Ka pai!**
