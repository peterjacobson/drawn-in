## 955 drawings until exhibition!

<br><br>

**Everyone is an artist**  

**Everyone has a unique charm**  

Drawn In asks 1000 people to draw each other,

to experience the joy of committing ink to paper,

to laugh at an accidental pig nose.  

By drawing you risk a perfect facade and find unexpected beauty,

on the page, and in each other

### Who am I to do this?
Am I an artist? Mmm. As much as you are. I'm Pete, a 27 year old navigating friendships, family, love, work and play. I'm from a little farm half an hour north of Wellington. I lived in Manchester long enough to appreciate NZ. I love connecting with people and popping [echo chamber bubbles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_chamber_(media)) - including my own.

There's a sketch of me below - can you guess which one?  

This project is about celebrating the artist in everyone, connecting people and having a laugh together.   
Oh. And hosting an exhibition party. It's going to be awesome.

<br><br>

### You can also help collect drawings!

I'll need the original paper drawings for the exhibition: send/drop them off to me at:  

Pete Jacobson  
Dev Academy  
Level 2, 275 Cuba St  
Wellington, 6011

### How to host the process
*Approach two people*  

"Kia ora, do you have <1-10> minutes to particiate in the art project Drawn In?"  

"Uh... Ok?"  

"Great! Here's paper and pens. You're going to draw each other. It's unlikely to be flattering. It's likely to be hilarious."  

*Optional:*  
"Here's a little poem by [Michael Leunig](http://www.leunig.com.au/) to get you in the mood:  
LET IT GO  
Let it go,  
Let it out,  
Let it all unravel,  
Let it free  
And it will be  
A path on which to travel."  

"You have <1-10> minutes to draw each other. Be bold. Go!"

*They draw. Hold a space of focus and humour. Maybe laugh with genuine joy at their drawings as they go. Encourage them*

"You have 30 seconds left..."  

"3... 2... 1... Pens down!"

"Now, on the back of the drawing, write your full name. Now write the other person's first name underneath"

*Let them see and enjoy each other's drawings*  

*Invite them to the exhibition, tell them to keep up with the project and exhibition at drawnin.nz*

**Ka pai!**
