Every human is an artist. Every human has their own beauty.

Drawn in asks 1000 humans to draw each other.  

Here we see the beautiful movement of the human hand over paper.

We delight in an expressive line  

We laugh at accidentally giving a friend a pig nose  

We rejoice in risking failure  

We take a chance

We create

We see each other
