# [Drawn in](http://drawnin.nz)

Every human is an artist

Every human has their own beauty

Drawn In asks 1000 humans to draw each other

Here we see the beautiful movement of the human hand over paper

We delight in an expressive line

We laugh at an accidental pig nose

We create, boldly and together!
